  title: Why Backwoods
  description: >
    Not all biochar is equal, in that it may come from many agricultural sources. We only use 100% hardwood, heated at optimum conditions, producing premium quality biochar. As a result, our customers have reported about 20% increased production.

  Backwoods is the ultimate biochar source for those who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
