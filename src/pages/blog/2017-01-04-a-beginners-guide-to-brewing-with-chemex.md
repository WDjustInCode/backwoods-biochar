In the Holocene, pyrogenic carbon left on the landscape was often beneficial to an ecosystem. In
the Anthropocene, however, elevated atmospheric CO2 from too much burning is putting our existence in
jeopardy. The imbalance occurred when we stopped merely burning extant biomass and started burning
carbon from earlier geological ages as well. Now driven by necessity to end our dependence on fossil
fuels, we are fortunate that science and technology have enabled us to also use biomass in natureenhancing, 
climate-positive ways. Through pyrolysis, for example, we preserve remnants of once-living
matter, honoring its life and allowing it to help preserve our own.

To acknowledge the life that once burned within these remnants, we prefix the name we give it
with “bio” (from βίος, the ancient Greek word for “life”). Biochar is a generic term given to carbonized
organic material. Depending on its characteristics (which can be diverse depending on its source), biochar
lends itself to virtually any form of agriculture, as well as innumerable other disciplines. Agricultural
methods that might incorporate biochar include grazing, agroforestry, alley cropping, silviculture, organic
farming, conservation agriculture, regenerative agriculture, aquaculture, hydroponics, horticulture, forest
gardening, and even row cropping. 

Burn by Albert Bates and Kathleen Draper offers dozens of other applications for biochar and IBI
members who receive our monthly compilation of research highlights see new possibilities conceived
every month. With potential applications innumerable as what we can imagine, should we be surprised
that biochar is even being evaluated as a covid-19 capture and kill coating for fabrics? Stand-by for more
developments on this.

IBI promotes biochar not because it can do everything better, but because it can do so many
things well. At this stage, we can put aside debates of quality vs. quantity because enormous biochar
quantities of various grades are needed in the emerging new carbon economy. The most prodigious use is
expected to be in construction applications using industrial grade char. 

The other main reason we promote biochar is because long-term carbon sequestration starts the
moment biochar is made. Whether it is then used to make cosmetics, livestock feed, or flash graphene is
not critical in solving the climate crisis. To draw down atmospheric carbon, we need to exponentially
increase the quantity of biochar produced. 

The theory of diffusion of innovation posits that at around a 16% market penetration level, a
tipping point occurs triggering a landslide of new customers. While we want to see biomass put to its
highest available use, IBI looks forward to the day when global biochar demand, from whatever sector of
the green economy, crosses this threshold.
